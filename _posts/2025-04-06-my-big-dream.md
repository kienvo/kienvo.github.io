Build a workshop with full of equipments, sit in it all days and nights, study
how the world works, read, make books, experiment, write.

Thing is, to build this workshop, I have to got money. To got money, I have to
work. But working drain my excitement, time and make me distract. I can't have
the "obsession energy" if someone tell me what to do, or someone tell me what to
learn.

<!--
The most distract things is human interaction. For me, I have been suffered to
learn anything from teachers, but siting alone I can actually learn it. Lots of
my friend wonder why I have the energy to dive deep in the field or how did you
learn so much? well, I am not, I didn't learn anything, that just results of my
curiosity.
