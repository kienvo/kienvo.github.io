Hi. I'm Dien-Nhung Nguyen (Nguyễn Phú Điền Nhung) - Author of `kienlab.com`.

If you see a nickname `kienvo` elsewhere, that's probably me. This site archives
things I've learned to reuse by myself or to anyone who is interested. The
reason why this site name and my nickname have `kien` in it is it's just a makeup name
that I use when I don't want to expose my identity. Now it is not
important but the legacy still remains.

I have been an electronics hobbyist since a child. My father, an electrician has
multiple kinds of electronic instruments and books about electronics in the
house. Without his guidance, I read the books and built various analog circuits
from basic to complex for my needs with components that I found around his
workbench. My main focus at this time is to build RF transmitter circuits and
high-voltage boosts.

In the 7th grade, the internet came to our village, I learned to program AVR on
a series of blogs at [HocAVR](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421145503/http://www.hocavr.com). My first project with a microcontroller was a
watch with a 128x64 dot screen and used AT89s52 to read RTC and draw it on
screen. It was inspired by [Lê Đắc Đảm](https://www.facebook.com/ledacdam). As I
have been playing with microcontrollers since then, I had a good experience with
C programming. In the 9th grade, I got my first laptop, and my GPA was
drastically going down because I spent all my time finding interest in
microcontrollers. [...]

In the grade of 10th, I first installed Ubuntu on my laptop. I was curious about
how Linux and OSes work, so I started to develop a small OS from scratch
following tutorials on osdev.org. During the development, I faced many
open-source tools and had to learn to use them. I learned a lot about how
computer architecture works.

Currently, I am a junior student at IUH, pursuing bachelor’s in Computer
Science. The reason why I choose CS is I don't want to be limited in the
electronic field. But that does not mean I don't have any deep knowledge of
electronics. I've been doing freelance electronic projects to cover living since
I went to uni.

Please drop a greeting at `dien.nhung at kienlab!com`. I am willing to talk about anything that is run by electricity.
